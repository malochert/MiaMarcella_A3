                <span class="h7">This single session pottery wheel throwing taster class will give you the perfect introduction to what it’s like to learn to use the pottery wheel. Have some hilarious fun while trying out something new or, if you are already experienced, just come to renew your clay connection! Our wonderful teachers will guide you every step of the way with careful, sound tuition and an open mind for fun! </span>
                <span class="bold">All students will get priority to book into our term classes at continuing student rates!</span>
                <h5>What’s Included?</h5>
                <span class="h7">A wonderful intro to clay and you can choose to keep two pieces for us to glaze and fire to be collected a few weeks later, fully included in the fee. You’ll be surprised that most people can learn the basics of how to make quite respectable small pots even if they’ve never done it before!</span>
